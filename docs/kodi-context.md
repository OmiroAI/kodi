# Kodi repository context

Kodi is a deterministic delivery coordinator, not an agent framework. Read
AGENTS.md and docs/operations.md for capability boundaries and delivery gates.
The coding and review containers cannot publish, merge or deploy. Host-only
helpers use the scoped GitHub App. Local tests run with:

```
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

PR acceptance also requires independent offline QA on the configured QA host, different-model
review, GitHub checks and human CODEOWNER approval at the candidate commit.
Keep runtime configurations, provider credentials and production outside source.

## Confirmed lessons

- GitHub check inspection uses paginated REST check runs and commit statuses.
  The installed CLI's GraphQL status rollup requests Actions workflow metadata,
  which exceeds the App's Checks-only grant. Do not add broader permissions to
  fix that query. Regression: paginated check-reader coverage.
  Verification: private-CI reader regression tests and independent acceptance.
- Review the entire candidate diff after repair, including earlier commits.
  Regression: complete-branch review coverage.
  Verification: multi-commit review-context regression coverage.
- Refresh canonical source with a fast-forward-only update; dirty, divergent or
  unexpected origins require operator maintenance. Never reset user changes.
  Regression: canonical-source validation coverage.
  Verification: canonical-source failure-path tests.

## PR #3: dashboard repository routing

The supplied [approval comment](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/3#pullrequestreview-5642775987)
contains no technical finding or reusable lesson by itself. The following guidance
from [PR #3](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/3) is verified against the current
`Coordinator.task_repository`, `Coordinator.sync` and `tests/test_sync.py`:

- Kandev task reads return selected repository associations in
  `repositories[].repository_id`; `repository_ids` is not the task response
  field. The original [PR #3](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/3) tests
  mocked the wrong field and therefore missed valid selections being blocked.
  Routing and repeat-sync regressions must use the association response shape,
  including an association ID distinct from its repository ID.
- Preserve explicit `Repo: <catalog-key>` routing before native dashboard
  selection. Without that line, require exactly one selected repository that
  resolves uniquely to the configured catalog; missing, unknown or ambiguous
  routes are blocked rather than dispatched to a default repository.
- Keep repeated Ready-task syncs idempotent by checking the board task ID before
  creating a GitHub issue. Native tasks do not persist the created issue URL;
  identical content on distinct task IDs still represents distinct work.

## Workspace-authored PR intake

[PR #6](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/6) addresses the assumption that
accepted PRs must use a coordinator-generated task branch. Host-side submission
records the existing PR branch; legacy jobs retain their derived branch. Merge
validation must still compare the PR, recorded commit, remote head and clean
coordinator checkout. Regression coverage is in `tests/test_submission.py` and
`tests/test_merge_maintenance.py`, including head drift and rebased external
branches. Reusing a PR number does not permit reusing acceptance after its commit
or requirements change.

## PR #14: binary and non-UTF-8 review material

The supplied [dismissed approval comment](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/14#pullrequestreview-5651201919)
contains no technical finding and refers to an earlier commit than the supplied
merged head. It does not establish a reusable lesson or approval for later work.
The following guidance from [PR #14](https://github.com/OmiroAI/kodi/pull/14)
is verified against the current source and regression coverage:

- Build review material from committed Git blobs at the base and candidate.
  Non-UTF-8 content can lack NUL bytes and Git's binary marker; inspect blob
  decoding too. Preserve complete UTF-8 patches and changed-file context alongside
  asset records containing before/after blob IDs, modes, byte counts and SHA-256
  hashes, with absent versions represented as null.
- Asset metadata alone is not review coverage. `Coordinator.review` requires a
  tool-enabled reviewer to inspect both revisions and report blocking findings
  when a format cannot be inspected. Asset reviews reject Qwen and text-only
  quota fallback; retry the preserved job with a supported reviewer.
- Fail closed when review material exceeds its budget; do not truncate source
  or invent a successful verdict. Retry coverage verifies preserved checkout and
  evidence, while acceptance still requires independent QA and different-model
  review for the exact candidate commit. Mocked reviewer responses test gating,
  not independent acceptance.
